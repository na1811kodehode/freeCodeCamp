              <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">1822</span> - Born in Heinzendorf (now Hynčice, Czech Republic), in the Austrian Empire to a family of farmers. From a young age, he showed interest in learning and science.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1834</span> - Enters a secondary school in Troppau (now Opava, Czech Republic). Despite financial struggles, his academic performance stood out.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1840</span> - Completes his studies in Troppau and enrolls in the Philosophical Institute in Olmütz (now Olomouc, Czech Republic).</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1843</span> - Joins the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno as a friar. Takes the name Gregor (from his birth name Johann Mendel) and begins theological studies.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1851</span> - Sent by the abbey to the University of Vienna to study physics, mathematics, and natural sciences. There, he learns about experimentation and the scientific method.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1854</span> - Returns to Brno and begins teaching at a local school. He also starts conducting experiments on plant hybridization in the monastery garden.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1856</span> - Begins his famous experiments on pea plants, focusing on seven distinct traits. Over eight years, he grows and observes over 28,000 pea plants.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1865</span> - Presents his groundbreaking findings on inheritance patterns (now known as Mendel's Laws) in a lecture to the Natural History Society of Brno. His work goes largely unnoticed at the time.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1866</span> - Publishes "Experiments on Plant Hybridization," outlining his discoveries. Despite its significance, it fails to gain recognition among the scientific community.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1868</span> - Elected abbot of the monastery, a position that limits his ability to continue scientific research. He turns his focus to administrative duties and tax disputes.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1884</span> - Dies in Brno at the age of 61. His pioneering work on genetics remains largely unrecognized during his lifetime.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1900</span> - Three scientists (Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak) independently rediscover Mendel's work, marking the beginning of modern genetics.</li>
                </ul>
