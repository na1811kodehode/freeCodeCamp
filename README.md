### FreeCodeCamp Survey Certification 


------------

This repository contains all the survey certification projects I created while following the [**Responsive Web Design**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/ "Responsive Web Design") course on [**FreeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ "FreeCodeCamp"). Each project demonstrates the application of HTML and CSS to build responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web pages as part of the course's hands-on learning experience.
